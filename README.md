# About Me Landing Page

The About page of Alexis Ortiz’s portfolio, showcasing my journey and commitment as a Frontend Developer. It also serves as my final graded project from the Udacity Frontend Development Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions

The assignment was to construct a multi-section landing page dynamically, to practice manipulating the virtual DOM.

### Additional Instructions
- To enhance the user experience, the section currently being viewed should be highlighted in some way.
- Furthermore, when a user clicks on a navigation item, they should be smoothly scrolled to the corresponding section, rather than being taken to the default location.

## Development Process

1.) I began the planning phase by carefully examining the instructions, rubric, and walkthrough for the project. I created an organized to-do list from the instructions and rubric, and took notes while going through the walkthrough slides presented by our session lead, Sharynne. I then spent hours reviewing all the concepts we had learned throughout the program, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To finish the planning phase, I wrote out the copy for the entire page so I could focus on solving and building from that point onward.

2.) During the prototyping phase, I sketched a rough wireframe of the landing page's key elements and design. To structure my code, I created a visual representation of the wireframe on a whiteboard. This allowed me to quickly add and erase elements, speeding up the design process. I also gathered and built assets, such as SVGs, color palettes, fonts, and custom PNGs, with intention and efficiency.

3.) I kicked off the development phase by constructing the HTML of the landing page, following the copy and incorporating the assets. I made sure the code was neat and precise, forming the basis for the remainder of the project. To guarantee the code conformed to HTML standards, I also ran the page through a validator. Afterwards, I styled the HTML elements with CSS. I made them responsive with fluid styling and media queries, to guarantee the landing page is compatible on all devices.
