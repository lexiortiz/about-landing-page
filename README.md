# About Me Landing Page

The About page of Alexis Ortizâ€™s portfolio, showcasing my journey and commitment as a Frontend Developer. It also serves as my final graded project from the Udacity Frontend Development Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions

The assignment was to construct a multi-section landing page dynamically, to practice manipulating the virtual DOM.

### Additional Instructions
- To enhance the user experience, the section currently being viewed should be highlighted in some way.
- Furthermore, when a user clicks on a navigation item, they should be smoothly scrolled to the corresponding section, rather than being taken to the default location.

## Development Process

1.) I began the planning phase by carefully examining the instructions, rubric, and walkthrough for the project. I created an organized to-do list from the instructions and rubric, and took notes while going through the walkthrough slides presented by our session lead, Sharynne. I then spent hours reviewing all the concepts we had learned throughout the program, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To finish the planning phase, I wrote out the copy for the entire page so I could focus on solving and building from that point onward.
