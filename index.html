              My personal values revolve around making the web universally
              accessible, creating products with a lasting impact, and staying
              at the forefront of web technologies and trends to ensure my

              I am committed to optimizing both the speed and the copy of my
              products, as copywriting is an essential part of any website or
              application â€“ conveying a message to the user in a clear and
              concise manner. I make sure that all copy is well-structured,
              error-free, and compelling to the user, as well as being optimized
              for search engine visibility and SEO. By staying attuned to the
              latest trends and technologies, I am able to create products that
              are both innovative and up-to-date. As a result, I can ensure that
              my products are of the highest quality, giving users the best
              experience possible.

            I always strive to create the most effective products possible

            It also includes developing for the best usability, and testing for
            compatibility across browsers, devices, and operating systems. All

          <div id="journeyContent">
            <p>
              After graduating high school, I was driven by my love for writing
              and decided to enroll in community college for a Communications
              degree. However, I soon realized that it wasn't quite the right
              path for me and decided to take a step back. Instead, I began
              exploring everything that interested me, from creative writing, to
              photography and graphic design.

            />
            <p>
              That's when I discovered the potential of websites and their
              endless capacity for innovation and communication. I threw myself
              into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was even lucky enough
              to be awarded a OneTen scholarship for the Udacity Frontend
              Nanodegree Program. I've fine-tuned my knowledge of web
              development and gained valuable insights from senior software
              engineers who act as mentors. I'm set to graduate in March 2023,
              feeling more confident than ever in my ability to be an effective
              front end developer.
