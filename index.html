          <h2>VALUES</h2>
          <p>
            My personal values revolve around making the web universally
            accessible, creating products with a lasting impact, and staying at
            the forefront of web technologies and trends to ensure my products
            are innovative. I am dedicated to crafting products that not only
            look aesthetically pleasing but are also highly functional and user
            friendly, regardless of device or browser. I am committed to
            optimizing both the speed and the copy of my products, as
            copywriting is an essential part of any website or application â€“
            conveying a message to the user in a clear and concise manner. I
            make sure that all copy is well-structured, error-free, and
            compelling to the user, as well as being optimized for search engine
            visibility and SEO. By staying attuned to the latest trends and
            technologies, I am able to create products that are both innovative
            and up-to-date. As a result, I can ensure that my products are of
            the highest quality, giving users the best experience possible.

          <h2>PROCESS</h2>
          <p>
            I always strive to create the most effective products possible
            through a comprehensive and holistic approach to development. This
            entails every aspect of the process, from structuring code in a way
            that allows for scalability, to utilizing the most modern and
            effective technologies for performance, security, and accessibility.
            It also includes developing for the best usability, and testing for
            compatibility across browsers, devices, and operating systems. All
            of these components are essential in order to guarantee that the
            best practices are being upheld.

          <h2>JOURNEY</h2>
          <p>
            After graduating high school, I was driven by my love for writing
            and decided to enroll in community college for a Communications
            degree. However, I soon realized that it wasn't quite the right path
            for me and decided to take a step back. Instead, I began exploring
            everything that interested me, from creative writing, to photography
            and graphic design. That's when I discovered the potential of
            websites and their endless capacity for innovation and
            communication. I threw myself into learning HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript and was even lucky enough to be awarded a OneTen
            scholarship for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program. I've
            fine-tuned my knowledge of web development and gained valuable
            insights from senior software engineers who act as mentors. I'm set
            to graduate in March 2023, feeling more confident than ever in my
            ability to be an effective front end developer.
