              My personal values revolve around making the web universally
              accessible, creating products with a lasting impact, and staying
              at the forefront of web technologies and trends to ensure my
              products are innovative. I am dedicated to crafting products that

            <p>
              I am committed to optimizing both the speed and the copy of my
              products, as copywriting is an essential part of any website or
              application â€“ conveying a message to the user in a clear and
              concise manner. I make sure that all copy is well-structured,
              error-free, and compelling to the user, as well as being optimized
              for search engine visibility and SEO. By staying attuned to the
              latest trends and technologies, I am able to create products that
              are both innovative and up-to-date. As a result, I can ensure that
              my products are of the highest quality, giving users the best
              experience possible.

            I always strive to create the most effective products possible
            through a comprehensive and holistic approach to development. This
            entails every aspect of the process, from structuring code in a way
            that allows for scalability, to utilizing the most modern and
            effective technologies for performance, security, and accessibility.
            It also includes developing for the best usability, and testing for
            compatibility across browsers, devices, and operating systems. All
            of these components are essential in order to guarantee that the
            best practices are being upheld.

          <h2>JOURNEY</h2>
          <div id="journeyContent">
            <p>
              After graduating high school, I was driven by my love for writing
              and decided to enroll in community college for a Communications
              degree. However, I soon realized that it wasn't quite the right path
              for me and decided to take a step back. Instead, I began exploring
              everything that interested me, from creative writing, to photography
              and graphic design.
            </p>
            <img src="Assets/SVGs/round-diamond.svg" class="diamondSvg"/>
            <p>
              That's when I discovered the potential of
              websites and their endless capacity for innovation and
              communication. I threw myself into learning HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript and was even lucky enough to be awarded a OneTen
              scholarship for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program. I've
              fine-tuned my knowledge of web development and gained valuable
              insights from senior software engineers who act as mentors. I'm set
              to graduate in March 2023, feeling more confident than ever in my
              ability to be an effective front end developer.
